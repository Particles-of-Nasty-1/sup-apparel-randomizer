# sup-apparel-randomizer
program to randomize apparel, created by !!Jaidon/Particles
To actually use this program you need to contact me for a list of .txt containing the proper commands to switch your apparel. While the program will still launch without them, it wont be able to swtich apparel.

1. Download the latest release from https://github.com/Particles-of-Nasty-1/sup-apparel-randomizer/releases
2. Unzip the file
3. Launch apparel_randomizer.exe | Windows will flag this file because there is no publisher
4. In the window that pops up set the path to your gmod.exe . By default its set to C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\GarrysMod but you may need to change this if your game is located elsewhere.
5. In GMOD open your console and paste this command 
  bind F9 "exec apparel"
6. Click Start
7. Profit
